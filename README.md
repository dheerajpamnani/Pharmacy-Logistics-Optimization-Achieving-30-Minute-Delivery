# Pharmacy Logistics Optimization : Achieving 30-Minutes Delivery.

Problem Statement:
The current delivery time averages 1 hour, which impacts customer satisfaction and reduces market competitiveness. This project aims to address these challenges by identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the delivery process and suggesting practical strategies to achieve a 30-minute delivery time.

Project Highlights

Data Analysis:
•	Used Excel to review delivery trends, breach rates, and performance metrics through pivot tables and charts.
•	Identified inefficiencies and delays in operations, particularly at specific source locations.

Insights and Recommendations:
•	Key Findings: Approximately 40.23% of orders exceed the 30-minute target.
•	Resource Allocation: Proposed adjusting staff levels during peak hours to handle high demand effectively.
•	Technology Integration: Recommended using route optimization software to shorten travel times.
•	Express Hubs: Suggested setting up dedicated hubs for faster processing of urgent deliveries.
•	Standardization: Advised replicating successful practices across all operational centers for consistent results.

Tools Used:
•	Excel: Performed data analysis, identified trends, and created visuals to support findings and recommendations.
