# Pharmacy Logistics Optimization: Achieving 30-Minute Delivery

This project focuses on identifying and optimizing key areas in pharmacy logistics operations to reduce the average delivery time from 1 hour to 30 minutes.

  Bsiness Problem:

Current logistics performance metrics reveal an average delivery time of 1 hour, which impacts customer satisfaction and competitiveness in the market. To enhance service delivery and meet customer expectations, this initiative aims to develop actionable solutions for achieving a 30-minute delivery target.

Key Features:
	Data Analysis:
	•	Leveraged Excel to analyze delivery trends, breach rates, and performance metrics using pivot tables.
	•	Identified bottlenecks and inefficiencies in delivery processes at specific source centers.
 
       Insights & Recommendations:
	•	Found 40.23% of orders are likely to breach the 30-minute target.
	•	Suggested dynamic manpower allocation during peak hours and the integration of route optimization software.
	•	Recommended express delivery hubs and scaling operational best practices.
 
	Tools Used:
        •	 Excel: Data analysis and visualizations.

       Datasets:
	•	Order Data: Timestamps for order placement, shipment, out-for-delivery, and final delivery.
	•	Breach Information: Details on on-time vs breached orders.
	•	Geographical Data: Source centers and customer pin codes.
	•	Payment Methods: Insights into cash-on-delivery (COD) and online payments.

      Outcomes:
         By implementing these strategies, the project aims to:
	•	Reduce delivery breaches by 40%.
	•	Improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
	•	Achieve sustainable 30-minute delivery operations through dynamic resource allocation and technology integration.
